        Hi, I’m Aviraj Kahlon! I’m a 12-year-old currently enjoying the adventure of Grade 7. One of my biggest passions is basketball—it’s more than just a sport to me, it’s something I truly love and have worked hard at over the years. I’ve been lucky enough to win three championships with my club team, which are some of my proudest moments. Those experiences taught me a lot about teamwork, dedication, and the importance of always pushing myself to be better. Balancing basketball with school has been a challenge at times, but it’s helped me learn discipline and time management, and I’m proud of how much I’ve grown through it all. Whether it’s on the court, in the classroom, or just spending time with friends and family, I always try to give my best effort and make the most of every opportunity. As I keep learning and improving, I’m excited to see what the future holds—I know there’s so much more ahead for me, and I’m ready to take it on!
